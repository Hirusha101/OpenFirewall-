# Open Firewall Project. ðŸ”¥ðŸ§±

A custom Python-based firewall built using `iptables` for traffic filtering and network security on Linux-based systems.

## Features
- Input and output traffic filtering using `iptables`
- Custom rule creation and deletion
- Logging and error handling
- Simple GUI using `tkinter`

## Requirements
- Ubuntu (or any Debian-based Linux distribution)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `psutil`
  - `tkinter`

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hirusha101/OpenFirewall.git
cd OpenFirewall 
```
### Step 2: Install Python & pip
Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can verify it by running
```bash
python3 --version
```
If it's not installed, you can install it by running
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```
Install pip. Install it if you don't already have it
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
Since this project uses tkinter, install it
```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Grant Execute Permissions (if needed)
```bash
chmod +x openfirewall.py
```

## Usage

### Start the Firewall
To start the firewall:
```bash
python3 openfirewall.py
```

### Stop the Firewall
To stop the firewall:
```bash
Ctrl + C
```

### View Current Rules
To list the current `iptables` rules:
```bash
sudo iptables -L
```

## Troubleshooting
### If Permission Denied Errors:
Ensure you have root permissions:
```bash
sudo python3 openfirewall.py
```

### Reset iptables Rules:
If the firewall becomes unresponsive, reset the rules:
```bash
sudo iptables -F
```
